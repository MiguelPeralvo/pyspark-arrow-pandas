# How does that PySpark thing work? And why Arrow makes it faster?

Presentation by I ([@berenguel](https://twitter.com/berenguel)) gave at the
[PyBCN meetup](https://www.meetup.com/python-185/) on June 2018 to explain how
Spark 2.3 has optimised UDFs for Pandas use as well as how PySpark works. A
recording of this talk is available
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=698441URsrc)

If you want additional information about Spark in general, I gave an
introduction to Spark talk with [Carlos Pe√±a](http://twitter.com/crafty_coder)
that you can find [here](https://github.com/rberenguel/WelcomeToApacheSpark).
